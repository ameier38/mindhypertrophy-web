                                                Hello! I created this blog because I wanted a fun and interesting way to improve my writing 
                                                and learn about new things. One of the best ways to learn, in my opinion, is to teach what 
                                                you are trying to learn. If you can explain something simply and clearly to someone else, 
                                                then you probably have a pretty good understanding of the subject matter. Therefore, I try
                                                to structure each post as a mini lesson, with someone completely unfamiliar with the subject as
                                                the audience in mind.
