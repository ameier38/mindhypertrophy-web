### Origin
Welcome! And thank you for visiting. This blog started as a seed of interest in learning how web applications work and has grown into a tool for helping me learn. I believe that one of the best ways to learn is to teach, and this blog serves as the platform from which I conduct lessons and the repository in which I keep track of what I have learned.

The process of writing each post helps me to understand and remember a concept through two ways: the act of writing about the topic, and writing it as simply and clearly as possible.

I have found that also writing about a subject instead of just reading about it helps me remember it much better. And if I cannot remember it, I can quickly refresh my memory since I will at least remember that I wrote about it and can quickly look it up. In the context of memory, writing or speaking about a topic is called the [_production effect_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128297/). Writing or speaking about (i.e. reproducing) a subject requires a deeper level of cognitive processing and can help create new memories.

In my experience, writing as simply as possible is the best technique for understanding and also remembering a concept. The act of breaking down what I have learned and communicating it in the most simple manner possible enables me to understand and remember the concept by rebuilding it in my mind. Dr. Richard Feynman once said after trying to prepare a complicated physics lesson,
>  “You know, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don’t understand it.” <sup>1</sup> 

This quote is one of my favorites from Dr. Feynman as the process of reducing a concept to its most basic form has been incredibly helpful for understanding and remembering any subject I am trying to learn.

### Site name
> _hypertrophy_: excessive development of an organ or part; exaggerated growth or complexity. <sup>2</sup>

If you Google _hypertrophy_ the number one site (at the time of this writing) is Muscle and Fitness magazine. People usually think of the word associated with _muscle hypertrophy_ in the same way that when people think of "working out" they mean in the physical sense. I believe that, just like lifting weights, you must train your brain. While the brain is not a muscle, mental training can improve cognitive function, just like training a muscle can increase its size and ability to work under a larger load. This blog serves as my mind's gym, and each post is a different workout.
